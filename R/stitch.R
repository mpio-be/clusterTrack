#' Stitch clusters by spatial overlap across segments
#'
#' Iteratively merge spatial clusters in a CTDF based on the area overlap of
#' their convex hulls. Clusters whose hulls overlap above a specified ratio
#' are combined into a single cluster ID.
#'
#' @param ctdf A CTDF object. Must contain an updated `cluster` column.
#' @param overlap_threshold Numeric between 0 and 1; minimum area‐overlap ratio
#'                          required to merge adjacent clusters. 
#'                          Clusters with overlap > threshold are combined.
#'#' @return The input CTDF, with an updated (in-place) cluster` column.
