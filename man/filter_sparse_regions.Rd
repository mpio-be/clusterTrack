\title{Top-Down Noise Pruning for Tracks}
\usage{
filter_sparse_regions(x, method = c("intersection", "density_gap"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class **ctdf** (from [as_ctdf()])}

\item{method}{Character; which pruning strategy to apply. One of:
- `"intersection"`   : remove non-intersecting segments (and optionally their neighbors)  
- `"density_gap"`    : remove segments in low-density regions as in xxx 2025.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the chosen methods:}
}
\value{
A  logical vector the same length as x.
}
\description{
A generic wrapper which flags segments by cutting out
}
\details{
This function implements a **top-down** noise-pruning step, splitting
away low-density or isolated portions of your track graph before any
downstream clustering.
}
\examples{
library(clusterTrack)
data(pesa56511)
ctdf = as_ctdf(pesa56511, time="locationDate")
