\title{Simulated ARGOS tracking data with 3 spatial clusters}
\format{
A data.table with 44 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
  \item{longitude}{Numeric. Longitude in decimal degrees (WGS84).}
  \item{latitude}{Numeric. Latitude in decimal degrees (WGS84).}

\description{
A toy dataset simulating ARGOS satellite tracking data for one individual.
The dataset contains timestamped locations arranged in three distinct spatial clusters.
}
\details{
This dataset is fully synthetic and was created to represent idealized movement
within and between three clusters. There is no associated individual or species.
