\title{Prune Dirichlet polygons based on area}
\usage{
prune_dirichlet_polygons(ctdf, queen = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctdf}{A `ctdf` data frame (typically created with [as_ctdf()]).}

\item{queen}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), uses Queen contiguity in neighbor detection 
(shared point or edge). If `FALSE`, uses Rook contiguity (shared edge only).}
}
\value{
A named list of class `nb` (from the `spdep` package), where each name corresponds 
  to an `.id` in the input `ctdf` and each element is an integer vector of neighbor indices.
}
\description{
This function computes Dirichlet (Voronoi) polygons from a `ctdf` object and removes 
those with unusually small areas (after log-scaling and centering), optionally using 
Queen contiguity to define neighbors.
}
\note{
Dirichlet polygons are computed via the `deldir` package. Only polygons with 
  `.filter == FALSE` and small log-area (relative to the sample) are retained before 
  neighbor construction. This is typically used to identify spatially isolated or dense 
  regions in tracking data.

ctdf = as_ctdf(toy_ctdf_k2,crs = 4326, project_to = "+proj=eqearth")
