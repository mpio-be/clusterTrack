\title{Filter by Segment Intersection}
\usage{
filter_intersection(ctdf, overwrite = FALSE, strict = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctdf}{An sf object whose geometries are line‚Äêsegments in sequence.}

\item{strict}{If TRUE (the default), only segments with both neighbors also isolated are kept.
               If FALSE, any isolated segment is kept.
#' @param overwrite Logical scalar; if \code{FALSE} (default), new filter flags
                     are updated with any existing \code{filter} column values; if \code{TRUE},
                     the \code{filter} column is replaced entirely.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input \code{ctdf} object whose \code{filter} was updated by reference.
}
\description{
Flags segments that are isolated (or isolated within their immediate neighbors).

\examples{
data(zbird)
ctdf = as_ctdf(zbird )
filter_intersection(ctdf)
